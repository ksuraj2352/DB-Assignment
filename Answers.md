1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.

In the diagram, there seems to be a ONE-TO-MANY relationship between the "Product_Category" and "Product" entities. This means that one product category can have multiple products associated with it, while each product belongs to only one category.The relationship is likely established through a FOREIGN KEY in the "Product" table that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" table. This foreign key is named "category_id".


2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?


To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, we can link the "Product" table to the "Product_Category" table using a foreign key constraint. This constraint guarantees that every value in the "category_id" column of the "Product" table matches an existing "id" in the "Product_Category" table.

Syntax Example

CREATE TABLE Product (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    category_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES Product_Category(id) -- This is the foreign key
);
